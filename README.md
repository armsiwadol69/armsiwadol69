<h3 align="right">About Me</h3>

###

<p align="left">I'm just an ordinary programmer who work for money to play arcade game(s) and plane ticket to Japan.<br><br>I play CHUNITHM and (use to play) maimai.<br><br>Yeah, lately Iâ€™ve been getting back into Arcaea â€” some of the paid song packs really hit my soul. So many tracks are just so good.<br>But honestly? I canâ€™t stand World Mode. Itâ€™s way too tedious.<br>Especially when it makes you play and clear certain songs just to unlock others â€” I really donâ€™t like that.<br>I mean come on, I paid 199 baht for this! (yeah yeah, skill issue ðŸ˜¤)<br><br>Back then, Project Sekai used to be my go-to rhythm game when I was out and about.<br>But now? Itâ€™s all about World Dai Star.<br>Bro. The game hits so hard â€” the devs clearly poured their heart into the gimmicks, the music is top-tier, and the cover songs and collabs with other series? Absolutely chefâ€™s kiss.<br>No joke, if you havenâ€™t tried WDS yet â€” you really should. Itâ€™s seriously that good.<br><br>I graduated with a degree in mass communication, but I like programming. (Who doesn't like cool air conditioning?)<br><br>You know what? Ever since Texas Chicken left Thailand, KFC's chicken has gotten smaller, drier, and way less tasty.<br><br>I guess you could say Iâ€™m a bit of a jack of all trades â€” I can do a bit of everything, even if Iâ€™m not a master in any single area.<br>I also enjoy getting R&D and POC tasks often.<br><br>I wear many hats, but when it comes down to it â€” JavaScript, Node.js, React, Flutter, and PHP are where I feel at home.</p>
